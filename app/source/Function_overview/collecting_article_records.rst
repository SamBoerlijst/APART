Collecting article records
==========================
Keyword generation is based on the titles and abstract from a csv containing article metadata. Such a file can be downloaded in many ways. Here I list three main options:
- Web of science: recommended for its ease of use and complete records, but requires institutional login.
- Google scholar: recommended for its accessibility as no login or software is required, but the number of scholarly queries is limited due to cloudflare protection.
- Publish or perish: recommended for its many features and integration of many search engines, but requires installation.

Web of science
--------------
1. Go to `Web of Science <https://www-webofscience-com.ezproxy.leidenuniv.nl/wos/>`_ and login with your institution.
2. Enter a query broad enough to capture the scope of the bilbiography you want to tag lateron and press search.
3. Click on 'Export' and select 'Excel'.
4. select the amount of records you want to import, and 'Full record' in Record content. About 200 articles are recommended, but the only true limitation is computation time during keyword generation.
5. Convert the xslx to csv using excel or equivalent.

Publish or perish
